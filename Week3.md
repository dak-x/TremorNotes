# Week3

# To Research:
- Token-less, password-less authenctication.
- Multipart-upload must use for streaming? Perhaps yes.
    
# To Do:
- Make a feature matrix for the sdk, and reason about what to use and what not to use.



# Stuff You realised:
Things will feel quite overwhelming, you just have to hit it head on. You almost always make some progress. 
If only you could realise that everything seems new, but in most cases gets pretty easier (atleast for you)
